# Bioinformatics Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains my learning and exploratory work in bioinformatics algorithms, developed as part of my coursework and independent practice. The focus is on understanding how biological concepts can be translated into computational and data-driven approaches using Python and R.

Rather than polished or production-ready tools, this repository serves as a working space where I experiment with algorithms, data structures, and analytical methods commonly encountered in bioinformatics.

## Motivation
Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that brings together biology, data science, and computer science. Many modern biological questions—such as sequence comparison, genome analysis, and evolutionary studies—require algorithmic thinking and statistical analysis in addition to biological understanding.

Through this repository, I aim to:
- Build intuition around core bioinformatics algorithms
- Strengthen programming skills in Python and R
- Connect biological theory with computational implementation
- Explore how data science techniques apply to biological data

## Contents
This repository may include, but is not limited to:

- Sequence-based algorithms (such as edit distance and alignment methods)
- Scripts for working with common biological data formats (e.g., FASTA)
- Algorithmic approaches applied to genomics and molecular biology problems
- Small experiments and exercises using:
  - Python (Biopython, NumPy, exploratory analytical workflows)
  - R (statistical analysis and visualization of biological data)

The emphasis is on learning and clarity rather than optimization or completeness.

## Interdisciplinary focus
The work in this repository integrates concepts from multiple domains:

- Biology: DNA and RNA sequences, mutations, evolutionary variation  
- Computer science: algorithms, dynamic programming, basic data structures  
- Data science: data handling, exploratory analysis, and basic statistics  

The goal is to become comfortable working across these disciplines rather than treating them separately.

## Status
This repository is a work in progress and will continue to evolve as I:
- Learn additional bioinformatics methods
- Improve my programming and analytical skills
- Explore more advanced computational techniques

## Disclaimer
This repository is intended for learning and experimentation.  
Methods and implementations may be simplified, exploratory, or incomplete and should not be considered validated or production-ready bioinformatics pipelines.
