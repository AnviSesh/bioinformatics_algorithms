<BS>Bioinformatics Algorithms
Overview

This repository contains my learning and exploratory work in bioinformatics algorithms, developed as part of my coursework and self-study. The focus is on understanding how biological concepts can be translated into computational and data-driven solutions, using Python and R.

Rather than polished, production-ready tools, this repository represents an active learning space where I experiment with algorithms, data structures, and analytical approaches commonly used in bioinformatics.

<BS>Motivation

Bioinformatics sits at the intersection of biology, data science, and computer science. Modern biological questions—such as sequence comparison, genome analysis, and evolutionary relationships—require computational thinking and statistical reasoning.

This repository reflects my effort to:

Build intuition around core bioinformatics algorithms

Strengthen programming skills in Python and R

Connect biological theory with algorithmic implementation

Explore how data science methods apply to biological data


What this repository includes

The repository may include (but is not limited to):

Sequence-based algorithms 

Working with biological data formats (FASTA, sequence records)

Algorithmic thinking applied to genomics and molecular biology

Small scripts and experiments using:

Python (Biopython, NumPy, basic ML concepts)

R (statistical analysis and visualization for biological data)

Each script is primarily written for learning and clarity, not optimization.

Interdisciplinary nature

This work combines:

Biological concepts: DNA/RNA sequences, mutations, evolutionary variation

Computer science: algorithms, dynamic programming, data structures

Data science: data handling, basic statistics, exploratory analysis

The goal is to develop comfort working across disciplines rather than treating them in isolation.


Status 
This repository is completly experimental as of now, inclined towards learning and depicts my intuition about the logic learnt in the class.


Disclaimer

This repository is intended for learning and experimentation.
Methods may be simplified, exploratory, or incomplete, and should not be considered validated bioinformatics pipelines.
